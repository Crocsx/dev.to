This is the third of a three parts Guides:

- Part 1 - Project Setup and Introduction to Web Component
- Part 2 - Add Custom Style and Property Binding
- Part 3 - Output Event and Allow Retrocompatibility


**Part 3 - Output Event and Allow Retrocompatibility**

In part one, we introduced Web Components, what they are and how to use them. We also created and set up an Nx workspace with an Angular and React project alongside a shared Web Components library. We created a custom element that "listens" to the attribute `title` and changed the `DOM` content accordingly. The second part added some custom styles and showed how to pass complex objects via attribute and property. 
In this final section, we will focus on Events and how to listen to them in our app and Polyfill to allow our web component to work on old browsers.

### 1. Dispatch and receive Events

If you follow the previous three parts, you should already have your monorepo setup with your shared library and the Angular and React app ready. We are going to create a new shared Web Component to showcase events. A simple counter that increments on button click and dispatches an event with the current value outside of the component.

let's start with the template, nothing new here :

```
const template = document.createElement('template');
template.innerHTML = `<style>
    #count {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <p>button clicked <span id="count">0</span> times</p>
  <button id="btCounter">Click Here</button>`;
```

Let's create the component code, a simple counter in which we can assign an initial value, which will increment according to each button click. There is nothing new here : 

```
export class DemoCounterElement extends HTMLElement {
  private _count = 0;
  get count(): number {
    return this._count;
  }

  set count(val: number) {
    this._count = val
    this.update(this._count);
  }

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
    this.shadowRoot.appendChild(template.content.cloneNode(true));
    this.shadowRoot.getElementById('btCounter').onclick = () => this.increment();
  }

  increment() {
    this.update(++this.count);
  }

  update(count: number) {
    this.shadowRoot.getElementById('count').innerHTML = count.toString();
  }
}
  
customElements.define('demo-counter', DemoCounterElement);
```

Export this component from your library (remember it's the `index.ts`) and import it in Angular and react :

In our Angular component template (we start counting from 1): 

```
<demo-counter [count]="3"></demo-counter>
```

And In our React component (we start counting from 2): 

```
export function App() {
  const counter = useRef<DemoCounterElement>(null);

  useEffect(function () {
    if(counter.current) {
      counter.current.count = 2
    }
  }, []);
  
  return (
    <div className={styles.app}>
      <demo-counter ref={counter} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

If you start both apps, it will increment the counter on each click, but we would like to know when users have clicked the button in our component. To do this, we will need to dispatch a [Custom Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) from our Web Component and listen to it in our apps. Custom Event is an interface representing events initialized by an application for any purpose.

In our Web Component `increment` method, let's create and dispatch a new custom Event.

```
  increment() {
    this.update(++this.count);
    this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent<{ count: number }>('incremented', {detail: { count: this.count }}));
  }
```

We use `detail` to pass any data we would like to share from this event. `detail` will be `readonly` once the event is initialized.

With this simple change, let's update our Angular and React to log the event in the console.

In Angular template, add :

```
<demo-counter [count]="3" (incremented)="clicked($event)"></demo-counter>
```

and in the component code : 

```
  clicked(event: Event) {
    console.log(event)
  }
```

For React, things as not simple. Our event is not a native one, and there is currently no simple way (as far as I know) to listen to that event directly from the template. You will either need an additional library like [xeact](https://github.com/pengzhanlee/xeact) or use the `ref` as we did for the properties. There are several issues in the React repository asking for easier management of custom events, but none have been implemented yet.

So we will need to use the `useRef` hook and the `useEffect` to add and remove our listeners.

```
export function App() {
  let eventRef: DemoCounterElement;
  const counter = useRef<DemoCounterElement>(null);

  const onIncrement = (e) => {
    console.log(e)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    let counterRef = null; 
    if(counter.current) {
      counterRef = counter.current;
      counter.current.count = 2
      counterRef.addEventListener('incremented', onIncrement)
    }
    return () => {
      if(counterRef) {
        counterRef.removeEventListener('incremented', onIncrement)
      }
    }
  })

  return (
    <div className={styles.app}>
      <demo-counter ref={counter}/>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Fire your app up again and check your console. Your log should appear in your React app.

Great, now you can pass attributes, properties and dispatch a custom event from your Web Components! One last thing is left for us, adding Polyfill to make them compatibles with old browsers. 


# 2 Add Polyfill

To ensure compatibility with older browsers, it is necessary to include a Web Components polyfills. Now, this is not a requirement, and it is OK only to target new browsers. The choice is up to you. As Angular says, "polyfills cannot magically transform an old, slow browser into a modern, fast one."

If you wish to allow an old browser to use your app, you will need to set up some polyfill to add additional code to the page and not break modern features that were not available before. Angular and React do not come with a specific polyfill for web components; we will have to add one manually. Luckily, there is a pretty popular repository that will do everything for us. 

In your project, install [`@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs`](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills)

```
npm install --save @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs
```

We now must load our Polyfill in Angular and React. For this feature, both frameworks work similarly.


Angular and React come with a file named `polyfill.ts`, which you will find in both projects `src` folders. We can add our Polyfill inside the file directly, and it will be loaded on pre es5 browsers.

Be sure to use the correct path.

`polyfill.ts`
```
 import "../../../node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js"
 import "../../../node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"
 ```

You should be ready to go. You will need an old machine or a VM to test this or some testing service like [lambdatest](https://app.lambdatest.com/console/realtime).


# 3 Conclusion

Great, I hope you learned something in those last posts. Web Component is a handy set of API that, without replacing current frameworks, can be a great tool to complete them. Please feel free to comment, point out mistakes or things I might have forgotten or mistakenly said.
